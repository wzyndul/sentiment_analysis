<h1 align="center" id="title">Sentiment Analysis App</h1>

<p id="description">This project uses the combined capabilities of Django, React, and a sentiment analysis model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
  
By integrating with the YouTube API, users can input a video URL, which triggers the backend (made in Django) to scrape comments. These comments are then analyzed using the RNN-based sentiment analysis model.

Frontend, developed with React, facilitates user interaction and presents the sentiment analysis results in an intuitive interface. This comprehensive solution offers users a seamless experience for extracting insights from YouTube video comments through sentiment analysis</p>
